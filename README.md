# Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development

## [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

## Notes:

This repository contains the answers to the [Full Stack Open version 2024](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course from the University of Helsinki. Throughout the repository I made an effort to treat each exercise as a commit with the # of the exercise, this was complicated in some cases but I did it this way so that those who review the answers do not have to work.During part 0 and 1 I was studying and solving the exercises from the Spanish version. But from [part 2](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2) onwards I started using the English version because it is more updated in some details from what I could see. During the course I made several "auxiliary repos", you can find some of the exercises solved with some of my notes about the course in: [this repo](https://github.com/fernargdev/full-stack-open-notes). Also the repos I made to deal with specific modules of this course are the urls in the readme of the specific module.
